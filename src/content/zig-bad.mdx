## Technical problems

I think all of these will be solved before 1.0.0 except for interfaces, which
is unfortunately the most painful one I've come across.

### No interfaces

This is Zig's biggest weakness. It dances around it with
`comptime T: type` and `anytype`, but those can quickly break down.

![Square peg, round hole](../images/square-peg-round-hole.webp "Sometimes you really need interfaces.")

For example, how can I tell the caller that I expect `T` to be constrained to
additive types?
```zig title="no-interfaces.zig"
fn foo(comptime T: type, a: T, b: T) T {
    return a + b;
}
```

Well, I guess I can compile `foo("hello", "world")`:
```sh title="zig run no-interfaces.zig"
test.zig:4:14: error: invalid operands to binary expression: 'pointer' and 'pointer'
    return a + b;
           ~~^~~
```

...that's not very helpful.

There's two bad solutions:
1. Write a comment that `T` must allow `T + T` and hope your readers read it.
```zig title="no-interfaces.zig"
/// Please only use `T`s that support addition...
fn foo(comptime T: type, a: T, b: T) T {
```
2. Rewrite the function using type reflection:

![Pig reflection](../images/pig-reflection.webp "When you reach for type reflection, things get ugly.")

```zig title="kinda-interfaces.zig"
fn foo2(comptime T: type, a: T, b: T) T {
    switch (@typeInfo(T)) {
        .comptime_float, .comptime_int, .int, .float, .vector => return a + b,
        else => @compileError("type " ++ @typeName(T) ++ " does not allow addition"),
    }
}
```
Now the compile error reads:
```sh title="zig run no-interfaces.zig"
test.zig:10:17: error: type []const u8 does not allow addition
        else => @compileError("type " ++ @typeName(T) ++ " does not allow addition"),
```

...but you are relying on the compiler to specify constraints AND enforce them.
It's like having no separation of power between the legislative and executive
branches of government!

You may think these examples trivial, but some patterns are just unruly.
Take readers and writers for example:
```zig title="my-reader.zig"
fn MyReader(comptime Reader: type) type {
    // what methods can I use on `Reader`?
    return struct {
        // what do you expect this function to do???
        // what's a ReadError and how do I add my own errors????
        pub fn read(self: @This(), buffer: []u8) ReadError!usize {
        }
    };
}
```

Ugh. IO in Zig using Readers and Writers has been the worst I've experience in
any language, bar none. Even C++ does better. The error casting problem leads
to such bloated binaries that `std.io.GenericReader` and `std.io.GenericWriter`
were invented to type-erase the error. Sure would be nice if there was a clear
interface that covered most use cases!

### No extendable structs

You cannot extend structs:

```zig title="no-extensions.zig"
const std = @import("std");

const Animal = struct {
    // you can make a new type with these fields via `@Type`
    health: u32,
    fur: bool,
    // but you cannot make a new type with this function
    fn heal(self: *@This(), n: u32) void {
        self.health += n;
    }
};

const DreamPig = @Type(.{ .@"struct" = .{
    .layout = .auto,
    // you can extend `Animal`'s fields
    .fields = @typeInfo(Animal).@"struct".fields,
    // but its declaration are completely ignored on the following line!!!
    .decls = @typeInfo(Animal).@"struct".decls,
    .is_tuple = false,
}});

const pig = DreamPig{ .health = 32 };
pig.heal(3);
std.debug.print("{}\n", .{pig});
```
gives:
```sh title="zig run no-extensions.zig"
:25:8: error: no field or member function named 'heal' in 'test.DreamPig'
    pig.heal(3);
```

Well, I guess I'll keep dreaming of my `DreamPig`. Here are the bad solutions:

![Pig](../images/pig.webp "There's an animal inside this Pig. It is NOT an animal.")

1. Use a field for the parent:
```zig title="parent-field.zig"
const Pig = struct {
    // I guess pigs _contain_ animals.
    // They are certainly NOT animals!
    animal: Animal,
};
```
2. Cleverly use [conf`usingnamespace`](#confusingnamespace) until it's removed.
3. Use code generation. This is what I decided on for
[flatbuffers](https://github.com/clickingbuttons/flatbuffers-zig).
It's not ideal when users want to modify their structs and then later
regenerate their code.

### Only integer error values

<figure class="flex flex-col items-center">
    <span class="mx-auto">I have problems.</span>
    <figcaption class="text-sm italic text-text/90">And they all fit into an integer.</figcaption>
</figure>

Sometimes you need to bubble up an error value besides an integer to another
programmer or the end user. The default error handler only allows integers:

```zig title="error-values.zig"
fn verify(password: []const u8) !bool {
    if (password.length < 8) {
        return error.TooShort; // this is an integer
    }
    return true;
}
```

Pretend for a moment that we computed that password and want to show the
invalid computation. You guessed it, we have more bad solutions:
1. Just log it. If you're writing a library you'll want to expose some `log`
options:
```zig title="error-log.zig"
fn verify(password: []const u8) !bool {
    if (password.length < 8) {
        log.err("password {s} is < 8 bytes", .{ password });
        return error.TooShort; // this is an integer
    }
    return true;
}
```
2. Create a custom Result type and abandon the nice `try verify()` syntax:
```zig title="error-result.zig"
const Result = union(enum) {
    too_short: []const u8,
    good: void,
};

fn verify(password: []const u8) Result {
    if (bar < 0) {
        return .{ .too_short = password };
    }
    return .{ .good = {} };
}
```
3. Use Rust or C++.

### Bugs, bugs, and more bugs...

![Lots of ladybugs](../images/ladybugs.webp "The past and current Zig codebase.")

I've
[had](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/16347)
[some](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/16440)
[flagrant](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/18966)
[errors](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/19606)
[over](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/19607)
[the](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/19452#issuecomment-2057740650)
[years](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/20148),
and there's
[still](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/19616)
[some](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/20055)
open even though I haven't touched the language in over a year.

They're really flagrant. Like "printing is broken" and "I cannot multiply
integers." The multiplying integers was solved a couple weeks ago.

### conf`usingnamespace`

This hurts code readability since I don't know which `usingnamespace` a
declaration comes from. Here's the
[discussion to remove it from the language,](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/20663)
which will likely happen.

### Confusing top level declarations

I find
["source file structs"](https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.14.0/#Source-File-Structs)
a confusing abuse of `@import()` rather than syntatic sugar that avoids typing
`const Foo = struct {`. It also happens to only work for defining a `struct` and
does not work with other containers like a `union`.

### Confusing builtins

Although the docs don't say, builtins are a mix of hardware instructions
(like `@prefetch`), and language extensions (like `@TypeOf`).

Some are downright confusing. What's the difference between
[`@mod`](https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.14.0/#mod) and `%`? I'll show you:

```zig title="confusing-builtins.zig"
fn getF32() f32 {
    return 3.0;
}

const a = 1 % 3;
const b = getF32();
const c = 1 % b; // error:
// remainder division with 'comptime_int' and 'f32':
// signed integers and floats must use @rem or @mod
```

...and what's the difference between `@rem` and `@mod`? The docs help out if
you look at the examples:
```zig title="rem-vs-mod.zig"
@rem(-5, 3) == -2
(@divTrunc(a, b) * b) + @rem(a, b) == a
@mod(-5, 3) == 1
(@divFloor(a, b) * b) + @mod(a, b) == a
```

Yeah, we could probably do without `@rem`. These builtins are constantly
changing, so at least the maintainers know it's a problem.

Here are some more:
- What does `@fieldParentPtr` do? It's
[about 5 pointer casts.](https://www.ryanliptak.com/blog/zig-fieldparentptr-for-dumbos/)
You'll have no clue until you read someone else using it.
- Why is `@FieldType(T, f)` preferential to `@Type(@field(T, f))`?
- Which builtins are for GPUs and how do they work?
- Why are there `log(v)`, `log2(v)`, and `log10(v)` instead of just
`log(base, v)`? Same for `exp` and `exp2`.
- Why must I use a builtin like `addWithOverflow` to access the overflow bit
instead of destructing a 2nd argument with `+%` or `+|`?

### Allocator is a mistake

![I need my space](../images/need-space.webp "...from my global allocator.")

Writing `std.mem.Allocator` gets real old real quick. It's nice for reading
what functions allocate on the heap, but so is a `new` operator.

Let me rebut each point of
[choosing an Allocator](https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.14.0/#Choosing-an-Allocator)
(which I will not repeat):
1. If you're making a library, your domain-specific problem probably lends
itself to certain sizes and amounts of allocations. The library author should
pick the best allocator for that. Dynamic allocators are only useful in the
rare case that sizes and amounts are specified by the user AND it's
performance critical.
2. If I'm linking libc, it has a no-fuss allocator that's faster than Zig's
equivalent.
3. This is a pain and now users have to worry about thread safety when choosing
an allocator!
4. I concede, the most interesting use of `Allocator`s are replacing many small
allocations with a large ahead-of-time fixed one that can be on the stack or on
the heap. However, these are often domain specific and on the heap, and you can
see point #1 for that.
5. See #4.
6. Idk why they repeated #5. This point should be removed from the docs.
7. This problem is a test runner problem, not an allocator problem.
8. See #7.
9. USUALLY NONE OF THE ABOVE APPLY, PLEASE GIVE ME A DEFAULT GLOBAL ALLOCATOR.
10. The allocator implementation is a separate problem from its abstraction.

Ironically, the recent
[SmpAllocator](https://ziglang.org/download/0.14.0/release-notes.html#SmpAllocator)
is a global allocator. But you still have to pass it around.

### LLVM compiles slowly

[This will be fixed eventually,](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/16270)
but in the meantime, LLVM's code quality is usually not worth the wait.

```sh title="i've spent hours looking at this"
> zig build
LLVM Emit Object...
```

Oh, and if you want to contribute to Zig or bootstrap it on a new platform,
you'll need to compile a custom fork of LLVM. That requires C++, Python3, and
an good 15m of a modern CPU's time.

![LLVM compiling](../images/llvm.webp)

Finally, [upgrading LLVM in Zig](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/pull/22780) is
a massive pain.

## Social problems

A lot of these are to be expected when a nerd gains authority. Herein lies why
I've stopped using Zig for about the past year.

### Mission statement

Andrew turned Zig into a non-profit
[in 2020,](https://ziglang.org/news/announcing-zig-software-foundation/) which
is a [good thing.](./zig-good#non-profit-zig-software-foundation-zsf)
But let's break down its full mission statement:

![Form 1023](../images/f1023.webp "Don't you love taxes?")

> The mission of the Zig Software Foundation is to promote, protect, and
> advance the Zig programming language,

Protect it from whom? Users suggesting bad features? Admins merging PRs that
hurt developers?

> to support and facilitate the growth of a diverse and international
> community of Zig programmers,

Diverse in what sense? Ethnicity? Why does that matter to a programming
language?

> and to provide education and guidance to students,

What education to what kind of students? Don't they have parents and mentors to
guide them?

> teaching the next generation of programmers to be competent, ethical, and to
> hold each other to high standards.

Why only the next generation? Competent in what sense? Handling all error paths
in their code? Ethical according to whom? US law firms specializing in
copyright law? What standards? The
[Zig style guide?](https://ziglang.org/documentation/0.14.0/#Style-Guide)

Zig needs a new mission statement that aligns with `zig zen` and the reason the
language started in the first place.

### Bus factor

Zig's [bus factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor) is one
[Andrew Kelley](https://github.com/andrewrk). I've listened to all his talks,
most of his livestreams, and read 1000s of his chat messages. I agree with 95%
of his technical takes, which is really special.

While I trust his technical leadership, I'm not so sure about his social
leadership. What drives Andrew's non-technical decisions? How is he managing
the few developers he employs? Why did a $5k bounty on an issue make him and
Loris
[write this angry post?](https://ziglang.org/news/bounties-damage-open-source-projects/)

While the non-profit does hold him accountable for the money he spends, I do
wish there was a board to hold him accountable to a new ZSF mission statement
that aligns with what users want from the language.

### Contributor neglect

I've done probably ~1mo worth of unpaid work on Zig's stdlib and generally
have been treated poorly. I contributed only when I faced bugs.

I faced a
[bug in the TLS client.](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/15226) The
existing code was very difficult to read and understand. The
client code failed to abstract the TLS layer which makes sharing it with the
[TLS server](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/14171) untenable.

So I wrote a [giant patch.](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/pull/19308) It
worked and was better than status-quo. Similar giant patches have been merged
before, but the unofficial crypto maintainer with merge permissions wanted it
broken up into smaller patches. I reluctantly agreed.

At first the ball was rolling, but then
[nearly 4mo passed](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/pull/19986#pullrequestreview-2373407230)
for a small patch *that he asked for.* During that period the maintainer was
active on Github... I guess he forgot multiple times or didn't care.

Meanwhile,
[extremely similar large patches](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/pull/21872)
are self-merged.

My poor contribution experience didn't end there, though.
While implementing the TLS server, I had to touch some buggy DateTime functions
that may actually contain a CVE. Rather than just solve my local problem I
wanted to solve it for the whole stdlib which had **three different
implementations.** I wanted to do so without compromise -- making it as fast
and generic as possible.

So I researched the
[state of the art for date math](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/spe.3172)
(which is pretty cool!) and spent a couple weeks implementing and testing it.

<Figure title="I hope you don't have to deal with calendars in Zig!">
    <span class="text-[8rem] icon-[tabler--calendar-code]" />
</Figure>

I commented on the existing DateTime proposal with my findings and opened a
PR that I hope would move the conversation forward. Andrew did not comment on
the proposal, but did
[reject the PR](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/pull/19549#issuecomment-2062091512)
and asked for me to create yet another downstream DateTime library. But wait!
This response contradicts the first point of his hatred for bug bounties:

> Bounties foster competition at the expense of cooperation.

Actively encouraging competition downstream excludes contributors from
collaborating upstream.

I'm sure all this could be solved in 10 minutes of talking, but as you'll see
in the next section, I gave multiple opportunities for this to happen.

### Championing issues

![Gladiator](../images/champion.webp "Me for DateTime and TLS.")

It's not clear how to win support for issues. You would think a problem as
simple as "print today's date" would garner some support, but in Zig you cannot
do this without a 3rd party library or doing complex date math yourself.

### Championing solutions

Take a blessed issue, like
[add std.crypto.tls.Server.](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/14171)

What's the official path for implementing it upstream? It's clearly not as
simple as "write, test, and open a PR" since that's been
[done](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/pull/19308)
[twice](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/pull/23005)
without progress towards merging.

Do I wait around for bi-annual reviews on small PRs?

Do I write angry comments on Github and IRC until someone with authority
answers?

### Please foster collaboration

I've opened issues, PRs, and talked in Discord about these issues. There's
been no collaboration by any maintainers.

The reality is that pieces of my PRs will continue to end up in the codebase
over time, but without crediting me. I guess that's what the
[Mission Statement](#mission-statement) means by:

> teaching the next generation of programmers to be competent, ethical, and to
> hold each other to high standards.

### Suggestions

Here's some basic steps the ZSF can take:
- Start a MAINTAINERS file.
- Maintainer response to open PRs within a month.
- Maintainer response to open issues within a year (or sooner if you pay).

If any of those steps were taken, I wouldn't be writing this.
